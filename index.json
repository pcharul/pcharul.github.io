In this paper, we consider low-rank matrices whose subspace evolves according to a state-space model and propose an online variational Bayesian formulation to learn the low rank components as well as the state-space model. Unlike the other matrix/tensor completion techniques, in our framework, the key algorithm parameters like rank and various noise power need not be fine-tuned and are learned automatically. We also propose a forward-backward algorithm that allows update to be carried out at low complexity manner. Simulations performed on the real world traffic data illustrates promising imputation as well as temporal prediction performance even in an online setup.","tags":null,"title":"Online Variational Bayesian Subspace Filtering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) has led to more effective models for ETA estimation that rely heavily on a large GPS datasets. More importantly, these are mainly cabs based datasets which may not be fit for bus based public transport. Consequently, the latest methods may not be applicable for ETA estimation in cities with the absence of large training data set. On the other hand, the ETA estimation problem in many cities needs to be solved in the absence of big datasets that also contains outliers, anomalies and may be incomplete. This work presents a simple but robust model for ETA estimation for a bus route that only relies on the historical data of the particular route. We propose a system that generates ETA information for a trip and updates it as the trip progresses based on the real-time information. We train a deep learning based generative model that learns the probability distribution of ETA data across trips and conditional on the current trip information updates the ETA information on the go. Our plug and play model not only captures the non-linearity of the task well but that any transit agency can use without needing any other external data source. The experiments run over three routes data collected in the city of Delhi illustrates the promise of our approach.","tags":null,"title":"To each route its own ETA: A generative modeling framework for ETA prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

Providing these services requires public transit agencies and private transportation players to maintain full situational awareness of the city-wide traffic. How- ever, most such agencies and companies are resource-constrained and do not have access to city-wide traffic data. The availability of sparsely sampled and outlier-corrupted traffic data renders the resulting traffic maps patchy and unreliable, and necessitates the use of sophisticated real-time traffic interpolation and prediction algorithms. Moreover, since the traffic data is measured and collected in a sequential manner, the estimations must also be generated online. Thankfully, the traffic matrices are spatially and temporally structured, allowing the use of time-series and matrix/tensor completion algorithms. This work puts forth a generative model for the traffic density and subsequently use variational Bayesian formalism to learn the parameters of the model. Specifically, we consider low-rank traffic matrices whose subspace evolves according to a state-space model with possible sparse outliers. Different from most matrix/tensor completion algorithms, the proposed model is equipped with automatic relevance determination priors that allows it to learn the param- eters in a completely data-driven manner. A forward-backward algorithm is proposed that enables the updates to be carried out at low-complexity. Simulations carried out on real traffic speed data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm better predicts the future traffic densities and the ETA as compared to the state-of- the-art matrix/tensor completion algorithms.","tags":null,"title":"Traffic Estimation and Prediction via Online Variational Bayesian Subspace Filtering","type":"publication"}]
